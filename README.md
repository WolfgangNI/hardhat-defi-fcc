Patricks code is for Aave V2, mine is for the new Aave V3


1. Deposit collateral: ETH / WETH (wrapped ETH)
2. Borrow another asset: DAI
3. Repay the DAI

# Forking TradeOffs:
Pros: Quick, easy, resembles what's on mainnet
Cons: We need an API, some contracts are complex to work with (where it would be nicer just to have a mock)

So depends on the projekt, what i want to do
