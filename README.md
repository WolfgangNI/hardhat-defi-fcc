Patricks code is for Aave V2, mine is for the new Aave V3
I'm having trouble with the V3 tho, waiting for help: ["Lesson 13: aave-v3 .supply( funciton deposits just a fraction of amount #5134"](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js/discussions/5134)

1. Deposit collateral: ETH / WETH (wrapped ETH)
2. Borrow another asset: DAI
3. Repay the DAI

# Forking TradeOffs:
Pros: Quick, easy, resembles what's on mainnet
Cons: We need an API, some contracts are complex to work with (where it would be nicer just to have a mock)

So depends on the projekt, what i want to do
